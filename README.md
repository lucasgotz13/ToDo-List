# ToDo-List

In this project I've built a ToDo List in which you can add, edit and delete a task. (WIP)

## Difficulties I've encountered
- Learning how to use correctly import and export modules was difficult as I couldn't understand some of its concepts
- It was difficult to implement the modal functionality
- Leading with some errors from webpack was annoying.

## WORK IN PROGRESS
- Implement local storage
- Implement a better edit task ui
- Implement projects
